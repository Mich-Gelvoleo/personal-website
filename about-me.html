    <article>Books</article>
    <p>
        I grew up reading several books and even until now, I still find
        it enjoyable to read something new and use my imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
        My favorite books are:

    <h2>"Get those bad thoughts out of your head. Youâ€™re going to be happy."</h2>
    <p>
        - Jose Arcadio Buendia
    </p>

    <h2>"You know how you can tell a person was killed by a Sirena?"</h2>
    <img src="img/book3.jpg" height="250" width="200">
    <h2>"This is what it means to live on. When granted hope, a person uses it as fuel, as a guidepost to life. It is impossible to live without hope."</h2>
