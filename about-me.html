                My parents are more lenient on buying books than toys as I grew up.
                The room is always crammed with bookshelves because I used to ask them
                for a new book every time we go to the malls. The following books at the side 
                are one of the best books I have read and will recommend to anyone I met. The first
                book from the left is Marquez' magnum opus and narrates the story of the Buendia Family 
                as years passed. The middle one is Malonzo and Victoria's collaboration of what happened
                to the country after contact with engkantos. Lastly, 1Q84 is Murakami's best work about 
                another dimension with two moons.

            I often explore different social media platforms to get ideas for what should
            I draw next or how to improve my drawing. I also play video games to immerse
            myself and study how these games were able to use art to convey their stories.
            I also like playing more for the plot and I will include here some of what I played
            and watched that I think others might enjoy as well (*¯︶¯*)

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            KALMIA is a prequel to SHAMA which also surrounds the main character
            in this video. What I like about WOOMA's work is the way they utilize
            a specific color palette to convey the expression of anger, hope, and redemption.
            Niru Kajitsu is also great on composing the song as it leads the listener to 
            what will happen to Hannah as she is captured by a powerful person. I hope to 
            really good like WOOMA soon so I practice really hard with what time I have.
