                My parents are more lenient on buying books than toys as I grew up.
                The room is always crammed with bookshelves because I used to ask them
                for a new book every time we go to the malls. The following books at the side 
                are one of the best books I have read and will recommend to anyone I met. The first
                book from the left is Marquez' magnum opus and narrates the story of the Buendia Family 
                as years passed. The middle one is Malonzo and Victoria's collaboration of what happened
                to the country after contact with engkantos. Lastly, 1Q84 is Murakami's best work about 
                another dimension with two moons.

            I often explore different social media platforms to get ideas for what should
            I draw next or how to improve my drawing. I also play video games to immerse
            myself and study how these games were able to use art to convey their stories.
            I also like playing more for the plot and I will include here some of what I played
            and watched that I think others might enjoy as well (*¯︶¯*)

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            KALMIA is a prequel to SHAMA which also surrounds the main character
            in this video. What I like about WOOMA's work is the way they utilize
            a specific color palette to convey the expression of anger, hope, and redemption.
            Niru Kajitsu is also great on composing the song as it leads the listener to 
            what will happen to Hanna as she is captured by Gui. I hope to 
            really good like WOOMA soon so I practice really hard with what time I have.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This is an adventure game with a slow burn. It really encourages
            the player to explore every nooks and crevices to further understand
            the story it has to present. What made NiTW memorable is that
            I had so much fun talking to different characters in the game and
            it also feels like real life with their characterization. I think
            what me relate to this so much is that I felt like I am Mae. I am in
            the point of my life where I felt like I am unsure of what to do.</p>

                I am not a furry.<br>
                I like Paru's art style so much.<br>
                I discovered this manga when I was in Grade 11 where it was
                still at its growing stage. The characters are not idealized
                and almost human-like (except that they are anthromorphized animals). This manga 
                is also now serialized. I also admire the character growth of Legosi as he struggles 
                with his instincts and principles.</p>
